# **Labs Overview**

This repository includes **a hands‑on lab**, that guides you through building a React Frontend that connects to an API server and performs full **CRUD** operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).


### **What to Expect in Each Lab**

[Part 1: Iterations 0–5](./part1.md) — Build a full CRUD front-end:
- A clear, **step‑by‑step walkthrough** for building the app.
- Each iteration includes a **sample solution** so you can compare your work or get unstuck.
- By the end of Part 1, you will have a fully functional React Frontend connected to an API.

[Part 2: Iterations 6–7](./part2.md) — Add authentication and route protection:
- **Iteration 6:** User signup & login with custom hooks (`useField`, `useSignup`, `useLogin`), JWT stored in `localStorage`.
- **Iteration 7:** Protected routes using `<Navigate>`, `Authorization: Bearer <token>` headers on POST/PUT/DELETE, and conditional rendering based on authentication state.
